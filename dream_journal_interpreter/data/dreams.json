    "symbols": "riding",
    "ai_interpretation": "This dream suggests a struggle with feelings of inadequacy and a fragile sense of self-worth (potentially indicative of Narcissistic Personality Disorder features).  The pride masking the lack of driving skill points to a compensatory mechanism for deep-seated insecurity. The crash symbolizes the inevitable consequences of attempting to navigate life without proper skills or preparation, reflecting feelings of lost control and impending failure (consistent with symptoms of anxiety and/or depression).\n"
